This project represents a trial to implement a RISC-V disassemble.

# Implementation:
- It depends mainly on reveiving a .bin file with the main function parameters. 
- Afterwards, the program keeps taking input and loading half words while checking whether the current instruction is a half word or not. This is done using the different in the first two bits of the two types of instructions (C, 32 bit). 
- Afterwards, the program calls the corresponding function that processes the 32-bit or the 16-bit instruction based on the output of the previous function. 
- The program begins dividing the instruction word into fields and begins to differentiate between them using fileds like (Opcode, funct2, funct3, funct4 and funct7). 
- Finally, the program outputs a certain command based on the specific case it reaches in the switch case at the end of the call tree.

# Limitations:
The program is limited only to 8KB of memory according to what is stated in the handout.

# Known Issues:
There are no issues.

    - defining a huge map for compressed and non-compressed istruction 
    - defining tasks and assigning deadlines for them. 
    - Developing the function responsible for diffrentiating between 16-bit and 32-bit instructions.
- Abdelaaty Rehab:
